# Challenge #1: Automating Christmas gift wrapping!


The elves bought a gift-wrapping machine this year. But it's not programmed! We need to create an algorithm that helps it in the task.




## Description

The machine receives an array of gifts. Each gift is a string. We need the machine to wrap each gift in wrapping paper and place it in an array of wrapped gifts.

As you can see, the wrapping paper wraps the string. On top and bottom, so as not to leave any gaps, the corners are also covered with wrapping paper.

Note: The \n represents a line break.

Watch out! Make sure you put the right number of * symbols to wrap completely the string. But not too many! Just enough to cover the string.

Ah, and do not mutate the original array!
