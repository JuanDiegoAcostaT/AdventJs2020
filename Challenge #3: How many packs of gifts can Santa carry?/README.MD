# Challenge #3: How many packs of gifts can Santa carry?


You receive a Christmas gifts pack that Santa Claus wants to deliver to the children. Each gift inside the pack is represented by a string and it has a weight equal to the number of letters in its name. Santa Claus's sleigh can only carry a weight limit.


## Description

Santa Claus also has a list of reindeer able to help him to deliver the gifts. Each reindeer has a maximum weight limit that it can carry. The maximum weight limit of each reindeer is equal to twice the number of letters in its name.

Your task is to implement a function distributeGifts(packOfGifts, reindeers) that receives a gifts pack and a list of reindeer and returns the maximum number of gifts packs that Santa Claus can deliver. You can't split gifts packs.

#### Things to keep in mind:

The gifts pack can't be splitted.
Gifts and reindeers' names length will always be greater than 0.
